# CFA-meetup.comEventChecker

## About
Our first node challenge was to use an existing API and create a terminal app that could benefit our lives on a daily basis. I use Meetup.com for finding tech meetups so thought it would be a cool idea to be able to search for events from my terminal!


### Installation
- Clone this repo
- run $ npm install to install the modules from the package.json
- run $ node index.js 
- enter your personal Meetup.com API key
- search for events with the set categories on Meetup.com
